# Coffee Shops
Sitting in a coffee shop, sipping my coffee, I realised something that’s been hiding in plain sight.

Some of the best tools I use — Obsidian, OpenClaw — are built on top of something almost embarrassingly simple: a Markdown file. A TODO.md. A SOUL.md. Plain text.

And that simplicity isn’t a limitation. It’s the superpower.

The things that are simplest often create the biggest effect. Complexity feels productive in the moment, but it’s expensive. It takes more energy to build, more energy to explain, and way more energy to maintain. Over time, complexity doesn’t just slow you down — it starts owning you.

That’s the lesson I want to bring into Conversify.

Because Conversify shouldn’t feel like “another dashboard”. It should feel like a lightweight operating system businesses can run from where they already are: WhatsApp.

And here’s the key shift: we’re not building for restaurants. We’re building for businesses — full stop. So we need primitives that work everywhere. The WhatsApp equivalent of TODO.md and SOUL.md. Universal, boring, durable building blocks.

If I had to choose our “Markdown files” inside WhatsApp, they’d look like this:

HOME.md — the control room. One message that always shows what matters today, what’s next, and the few actions you can take.

TODO.md — the operator loop. A simple, prioritised list of what the business should do next: reply to customers, review a scheduled broadcast, follow up leads, fix what’s underperforming.

RULES.md — the soul. The playbook: brand voice, messaging boundaries, compliance guardrails, frequency limits. The rules that keep things consistent and safe.

STATS.md — the truth. A tiny snapshot of performance: reach, replies, opt-outs, and one outcome metric that actually matters.

That last part is important: instead of hard-coding “offers” or “redemptions”, we define one universal concept:

Outcome.

Every business chooses their outcome:

a restaurant: redemption

a gym: trial booked

a clinic: appointment confirmed

a service business: quote accepted

an ecommerce brand: purchase

Once you have an outcome, the whole system becomes clean:

broadcast → inbox → outcome → stats → todo

No bloat. No clutter. No “enterprise dashboard” energy.

Maybe we still build a dashboard. Maybe we don’t. But the direction I love most is this: the business should be able to pull what they need directly from WhatsApp — with a few commands, a few buttons, and a few predictable “pages” that always render the latest reality.

Simple enough to learn in one day.
Strong enough to run a business.
Light enough to scale across any industry.

That’s the goal.

Keep it simple. Make it obvious. Make it feel like text files powering an operating system — because honestly, that’s where the magic seems to live.
