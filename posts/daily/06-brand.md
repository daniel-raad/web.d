I've been thinking a lot about brand lately. Not in the corporate, polished LinkedIn kind of way. More in the — what do I actually want to be known for, and how does that compound over time.

Right now I'm balancing three things: I work at **Palantir**, I'm building **Conversify** (my own company), and I'm training for an **Ironman 70.3**. On paper that sounds insane. In practice, it works — with hard work, good systems, and an honest relationship with yourself about what's sustainable and what isn't.

This post is me laying out why I'm choosing to share the journey publicly.

## Why Brand Matters for Engineers

The "just write code" career path is getting commoditized. AI is accelerating that. What's appreciating in value is something different:

- **Systems thinking** — understanding how to design, scope, and ship entire products, not just features
- **Domain expertise** — knowing _what_ to build, not just _how_
- **Distribution** — the ability to get attention, trust, and users
- **Judgment** — knowing when to use AI, when not to, what to build vs buy

Writing code is the baseline now. The engineers who stand out are the ones who can think beyond the codebase. The ones who ship products, build audiences, and have a point of view.

## The Three Pillars

**Palantir** gives me credibility, a world-class network, and exposure to how large-scale systems and AI deployment actually work across government, defense, and enterprise. The signal carries weight, and the learning is relentless. I love my job.

**Conversify** is the real differentiator. The goal is to grow it into the default WhatsApp marketing company — and in the future, scale to all messaging platforms. We're building a restaurant loyalty and messaging platform with AI-powered conversations, multi-tenancy, automated campaigns, the works. Most engineers never ship their own product. I have. And I'm going to keep going.

**Ironman 70.3** keeps me sharp. It forces discipline, structure, and recovery into my life. Training at 6AM before a full day at Palantir and then building Conversify until 10PM — that's not survivable without systems. The training is the system. It's the thing that holds everything else together.

## Why Build in Public

Two reasons.

**One — to help others.** I want people to see that you can balance a demanding job, a startup, and an ambitious athletic goal. Not by being superhuman, but by having good systems and being honest about when things aren't working. If reading this helps even one person believe they can do more than they thought, it's worth it.

**Two — to keep myself accountable.** Writing forces clarity. If I can't articulate what I'm doing and why, that's a signal I need to rethink. These posts are my own feedback loop. A public journal that I review, reflect on, and use to course correct.

## What You'll See Here

I'm going to share the real journey. Not curated highlights. The actual process of:

- Growing Conversify from early traction to the default in its space
- What it's like working at Palantir while running a company on the side
- Training for an Ironman when your calendar is already full
- Technical decisions, product thinking, and lessons learned the hard way
- The weeks that don't work, and what I change

If you're an engineer, a founder, or just someone curious about what it looks like to bet on yourself across multiple fronts — stick around. The ceiling is high in every direction. All I've got to do is reach.
