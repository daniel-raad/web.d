A question which goes back and forth in my head is whether I'm making the right choice investing so much energy into my own business. Its a challenge, it takes time, and it takes a lot of energy. Would I be better of just spending all the time after work on Palantir. Maybe. Yet again, maybe not. But no matter what, it has taught me a lot of lessons, and is exciting to see every milestone we achieve.

Not having grown up around entrepeneurs (my dad was one but I wouldn't say I grew up around that), its crazy to have imagined myself breaking this ground, with every yard being won hard fought. I hope to provide my children a role model they can look up to in this sense. Ambitious and demanding more from myself. Willing to fail. I know I keep telling myself I should quit, but I know I have people rely on me. So nows not the time. But it will come.

We need to continue grinding this out, and striking while there is apetitie for us. We need to get ahead of the curve with the AI boom (despite the AI Boom already happening). But we have a LONG journey ahead of us. And I just need to remind myself that. I will continue to demand a lot from the other two, as they demand from me. And we will continue forging the best out of one another.

I operate differently. Maybe other people wouldn't be comfortable doing Palantir, their own Business and an Ironman 70.3. But I can. and I will. Why shouldn't I? Why shouldn't anybody. My kids will know that I did it. Despite any card that ever went against me. They will know I had a lot of love around me, my mum, my sister, their mum (love you Melisa). With some love, some guts and a positive mindset, it can all be overcome.

Strike while the iron is hot. And if its not hot, strike anyway.

A quick review of this week for myself. The midweek lapses need to stop. From today onwards, you will have a system in place to ensure that they don't occur. No more sleeping past 11. To function you need sleep - it supports everything, recovery, mood, cortisol. Without it, you're always running on fumes and your mood disolves into something terrible. You can see it happening before you. As soon as I got my sleep back under control this week everything changed for the better.

During the week:
6AM - 8AM: Ironman (whatever training you want to do, but it must be done) - In the gym, at home, on the road. Just DO IT.
8AM - 6:30PM: Palantir - I love my job, and its fantastic experience around fantastic people. Learn. Grow.
7PM - 10PM: Conversify - make this planned out, know what you want to accomplish everyday and get it done. Saturday and Sunday can be for larger tasks. This will be 8PM-10PM when I'm in the office, but is the only addendum. We DONT sacrifice sleep.
10PM - 11PM: Read, R&R, Quick Journal Prep for Next Day.

This will help me structure each week. If I need a one off pass, this is also okay, but should only ever be one day a week which is missed.
