I'm feeling frustrated by having two feet split, walking in different directions. I want to be successful and I don't want to let anyone down. I'm working as hard as I can but it feels like I'm always pushing against myself, forcing myself to not succeed. It feels awkward writing this in a public setting, despite knowing noone is likely to read this. In reality, if you read this, I hope these thoughts are useful to you. It is thrilling and tiring working for a demanding company with high expectations, and working on your own start up. The possibilities are limitless, you really can steer in any direction you wish to go. But they are also so limited. Limited by time, energy and responsibilities. Do you do the things you really want to do, or do what you have to do. I've not answered this yet. I haven't defined success for myself yet. The ceiling is high in either direction, I'm confident of that. All I've got to do is reach.
