# Hello World

Welcome to my blog! I'm committing to writing one post a week here. Posts will cover things I'm working on, things I'm learning, and things I find interesting.

## Why blog?

Writing helps me think more clearly about the things I'm learning. If something I write here is useful to you too, that's a bonus.
